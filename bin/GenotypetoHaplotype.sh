###  Preamble  ###

#   This script takes variants from a VCF file that make up a specific *allele haplotype and condenses them from variant call genotype to *allele haplotype genotype for downstream use. 
#   The major assumption of this condensation is that all variants are required to be alternative for one or both alleles to achieve a haplotype genotype of heterozygous or homozygous reference, respectively (i.e. 0/1 + 1/1 + 1/1 = 0/1)
#   This assumption may not necessary be true for all star alleles (i.e. only one of the variants is required for the phenotype), but this is a limitation of the data we have currently.
#   Additionally, this does not consider the possibility that alleles are in trans (i.e. 1|0 + 0|1 = 0/1 despite being 0/0 by the previous definition). There is no guarantee that variants will be in phasing distance and we don't have parentals.
#   Technical assumptions: GT fields only from fifth column onwards, only ref and alt (i.e. 0 and 1, but not 2+), that genotypes will be seperate by / or |, and missing information (i.e ./.) is currently being handled as 0/0).
