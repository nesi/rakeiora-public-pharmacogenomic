If this file is present, the gatherAlea utility will be
executed, and clinical data for all participants associated
with the samples selected in the workflow execution will
be requested and placed in the ./alea directory (which
will be created if it doesn't exist).

Rakeiora administrators can configure Rakeiora to
retain the raw responses from the alea endpoint in
this alea directory, and also to copy the contents
of this alea directory at the end of workflow execution
to your jupyterhub so you can see these results.

Once real data is online, however, this should
be disabled as this clinical data should not leave
the walled garden network.
